I'm orchestrating AI to amplify human creativity and harmonize with nature. From hand-crafted AI agents to cinematic storytelling, I build tools that empower dreamers to shape a permapunk future.

ðŸŽ¥ **What Drives Me**
- **AI Orchestration:** Crafting collaborative AI agents that dance together like a digital symphony, managing workflows with precision and soul. Think hand-built systems that make tech feel alive.
- **Moving Pictures:** Creating films and animations that blend tech and natureâ€”powered visuals and storytelling.
- **Homestead Vibes:** Living the permapunk dream, merging gardening, travel, and surfing with cutting-edge tech.

---

ðŸš€ **Current Projects**
- **Homestead Hub App:** The Homestead Hub is my shared family homesteading system designed to help me on the Homestead to keep track of tasks and whats cracking in the forest garden which is a mare and to get the kids involved in playing with AI, its their future we programming after all. .
- **Tech Whispers:** A multimodal series weaving tech insights with homestead wisdom. Episodes on the brewâ€”stay on substack!
- **Hand-Crafted Orchestration:** Building multi-agent systems inspired by natureâ€™s ecosystems, where each agent plays a role in a larger workflow. Check my work and writings for orchestration experiments matching Nvida Agent IQ.
- **Solarpunk Inspired Visuals:** Creating visuals that fuse tech and nature in a new PermaPunk style.

> Tech isnâ€™t just codeâ€”itâ€™s a garden. I plant seeds, nurture them with human ingenuity, and watch them grow into tools that free us to dream bigger. Join me in cultivating a world where tech and nature thrive together.

âš¡ **Fun Future Spark**

Physical AI has arrived, transforming our world into a thriving, nature-rich paradise. Imagine cities where lush seas of vibrant colors and wildlife surround you, with narrow paths winding through verdant landscapes. Organic, living buildings breathe fresh air, blending seamlessly with their surroundings. Gravity crafts glide above, and pathways are lined with fruit trees and healthy, edible vegetation, free for anyone to enjoy. This ecosystem is sustained by Naturoidsâ€”advanced AI systems designed to nurture nature.

Naturoids tend to your garden, harvest hard-to-reach crops, or maintain community spaces. Picture a fleet of Naturoid Olive Harvesters collecting olives for the local press, or Naturoids collaborating to replenish free food markets, ensuring no apple goes to waste. These intelligent systems empower communities, foster sustainability, and reconnect humanity with nature. Iâ€™m training the AI LLM's to plug into this future reality, seamlessly connecting technology and the natural world.
